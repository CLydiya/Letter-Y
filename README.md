        a representation for the sequence numbers from the Collatz Conjecture. But what is that? I will explain about it in this article.
    </p>
    <h2>The Conjecture Statement and The Problem</h2>
    <p>The collatz conjecture is a sequence that is generated by taking any positive integers:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>If it is even, then divide it by 2</li>
            <li>If it is odd, then triple is and plus 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <code> 
            def collatz(n){
            if n == 1;<br>
                return 1;<br>
            elif n % 2 == 0;<br>
                return collatz(n/2);<br>
            else;<br>
                return collatz(3*n+1);<br><br>
            }
        </code>
        For example, I choose the number 7. It is odd, so I triple is and plus one. I get 22. It is odd, so I divide it by 2, and the result is 11. It is even, so I triple it and add 1; I get 34. I keep on doing this until I get 4, then 2, then 1. If I keep doing
        the same thing again, I'll just end up in a paradox - 4, then 2, then 1. Now, I choose another positive number, 6. This is what I get: 6-3-10-5-16-8-4-2-1. This is simple, right? If it is simple like that, then why does it remain unsolved? Well,
        although the problem on which the conjecture is built is remarkable simple to explain and understand, the nature of the conjecture makes proving or disproving the conjecture exceddingly difficult. Now, let's take a look at both of the number I
        chose. It ended up with 1. What if I choose another number? Will it ends up with 1? Of course, computer have been used to try finding a counter example, and every number less then 2^68 will end up with 1. So that means the cojecture is true? But
        how to proof? And that's the point. That's what keep mathematicians takling the problem for decades. That is why many authors have previously stated, the prolific Paul Erdos once said, <q>Mathematics is not ready for such problems.</q></p>
        <h2>A Brief History Behind The Collatz Conjecture</h2>
        <p>There is no specific information on the origin of Collatz Conjecture. Accoring to research, <a herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">wikipedia</a> claimed that the Collatz Conjecture is named after the Germany mathematicians, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Collatz">Lothar Collatz</a> in 1937. But <a href="https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/3587/what-is-the-origin-of-the-collatz-conjecture">another  source</a> show that sir L.Collatz didn't propose the conjecture. They stated that the first publication was in 1963. The conjecture also appears in his notebook in 1932, but he never proposed it, and there was no the year 1937 in his letters in 1976-1980.<br>However, even if we don't know the real origin of the Collatz Conjecture, but we know that the conjecture is named after him.</p>
        <h2>The Previous Progress on the collatz conjecture</h2>
        <p>Back in February 2022, a mathematician, <a hraf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao">Terrence Tao</a>, announced that he had had the partial proof of the conjecture in his<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/"> blog post</a> and on his <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03562">arxiv paper</a>. <br>Before his proof, there were many mathematicians who tried to takling the conjecture. One of them were Lagarias. He published a book about it <cite>The Ultimate Challenge: The 3x + 1 Problem</cite>Later, Tao made a few attempt on this unsolved problem. One day, he read a comment on his blog post from an anonymous reader, suggesting him to try solving the conjecture for <q>almost all</q> numbers, rather than trying to solve it completely. Eventually, he realized that the conjecture was similar to the partial differential equations. He also recognized that techniques for the partial differential equations could apply to the conjecture. The techniques involved the statistical way of studying the behavior of starting values and expolating from there long-term behavior of all possible starting configurations of the pond. In his context, if the number that you applied end up exactly at 1 or close to 1, then almost all of the numbers behave the same way. His challenge is that you may start with a good sample,  but five iterations later, it's skewed because the numbers will change as you iterate it. Hia key insight was figuring out how to choose a sample of numbers that largely retains its original weights throughout the process. The result is that the sample he starts with maintains its character even as the process proceeds. He uses this techniques and successfully proved that almost all Collatz starting value eventually reach a value that is close to 1. He could conclude that 99% of starting values greater than 1 quadrilliom eventually reach a value below 200. <br>However, it is incapable of reaching a full proof of the conjecture because his starting sample still skews a little. The proof of the full conjecture would likely depend on a different approach.</p>
